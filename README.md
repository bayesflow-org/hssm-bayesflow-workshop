# Transforming Cognitive Modeling Workflow with BayesFlow

Welcome to the tutorial repo on supercharging cognitive modeling workflow with simulation-based inference (SBI). In this tutorial, we will harness the power of deep learning through [BayesFlow](\https://bayesflow.org) by applying it to the powerful [Sequential Sampling Model Simulators (SSMS)](https://lnccbrown.github.io/ssm-simulators/api/ssms/). By the end of this tutorial, you will get the best of both worlds and be empowered to accelerate your cognitive modeling workflow!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Get the Workshop Materials

You can either **clone the repository** (if you're familiar with Git) or **download it as a ZIP**.

#### üîß Option 1: Clone with Git (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hssm-bayesflow-workshop.git
cd hssm-bayesflow-workshop
```

#### üì¶ Option 2: Download ZIP
1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file and navigate into the folder

### 2. Install the necessary packages

#### Option A: Using uv (recommended)

This repository includes a `pyproject.toml` file for easy dependency management with `uv`. If you have `uv` installed, you can set up the environment with:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create and activate a virtual environment with all dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

#### Option B: Using pip

Make sure to install BayesFlow and SSMS for the Python version you use for this workshop:

```bash
pip install bayesflow ssm-simulators
```

You can also install conda and install the packages from an environment you create for the workshop materials.

### 3. Let's GO!
